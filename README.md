# Batch-Infogather
I made these scripts when I was 11-13 years old to gather general system info, feel free to modify and use them, otherwise you can make suggestions on how to improve.
The main script is infogather 7.0 and it will open infosideload so that they can both run at once, the log will be called the name of the current computer.
